# Sub-Troll (lithic-card-manager)

App to controll subscriptions using lithic virtual cards and connect with data from apps that rate or manage subscription services. Made to be a companion for What2Watchlist.com.


Phone App for users to manage virtual cards.

Allows a web service to suggest best available services and let the user manage their payment process. Intended for small teams not able to take on the liability of issuing cards in peoples names.

Built for What2Watchlist but capable of extending to other services.
